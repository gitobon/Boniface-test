          <h2>Masai Mara national Park  </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
The Maasai Mara National Park or the Mara game reserve as most Kenyans call it, is a beautiful national reserve in Kenya, bordering the Serengeti in Tanzania. For anyone who’s ever flicked through a safari guide, the Masai Mara needs little introduction. Although markedly smaller than many of East Africa’s safari gems (it’s 1500 km2 in size), boy does it pack a lot in. The original home of the Maasai people, Mara means ‘spotted land’, so named for its boundless plains lightly sprinkled with acacias and kopjes. This scene has become the face of African safaris and set the Masai Mara firmly at the top of Kenya’s ultimate safari spots. It also happens to be home to some of the highest densities of wildlife in Africa, which provide some of nature’s most breathtaking spectacles. Majestic, strolling herds of elephant, the clash of Africa’s biggest cats and the heart-pumping thrill of the Great Migration…It all awaits on a <b>Masai Mara safaris. </b>  On a <b>Masai Mara safari, </b>  game drives are a definite staple and allow you to cover the most ground, keeping pace with the thundering herds of wildebeest and watching all the big cat action. You can also take full advantage of a full-day drive so you never miss a moment. Bush walks are possible in some of the private conservancies, and you’ll trace the movements of a beetle, uncover hidden burrows and learn to track wildlife on foot with a Maasai guide. You could even join the throngs on horseback and get closer to the wildlife than you thought possible or gaze over the sprawling plains and ant-sized antelope from a hot air balloon. While the Masai Mara’s bucket list-defining reputation precedes it, so does the price tag. A Masai Mara safari may be expensive but it has a good excuse – everything from game drives to walking safaris to bush dinners tend to be included in the price. Not to mention your dollars are fed into community and conservation projects that work to preserve this beautiful place. Over the years, we’ve picked up a tip or two for saving some pennies in the Masai Mara – and all without compromising on the experience. While it may be tempting and time-saving to fly from place to place, Kenya’s layout makes it possible to drive between most safari destinations, which also means you’ll benefit from having a private guide for the duration of your trip. Lastly, any safari outside of peak season means a drop in the cost – but more on that later.

            <h2>Great Migration  </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
The Maasai Mara is the most popular safari destination in East Africa, along with the Serengeti in northern Tanzania. It is the site of the Great Migration, where over 2 million zebras, gazelles and wildebeest travel from Serengeti to the Maasai Mara each year. Often called the Jewel of Africa, the Maasai Mara takes its name from the Maasai tribe who have inhabited these lands since the 17th century. Mara translates to spotted, referencing the scattered acacia trees that mark the landscapes, and that have become the symbol of the Maasai Mara. Located in Kenya's South West, the Maasai Mara National Reserve covers just over 583 square miles. Unlike national parks, the Maasai Mara has no fencing and is instead bounded by the Ololoolo (Siria) Escarpment on its western edge and extends south to the Tanzania border, where it seamlessly merges with the Serengeti National Park. However, the reserve's northern and eastern borders are surrounded by private wildlife conservancies.The conservancies add 350,000 acres to the greater Mara area, and animals are free to roam anywhere within the Mara ecosystem. There are fourteen in total, but the top four conservancies, also known as the 'Big Four' are: Mara North, Mara Naboisho, Ol Kinyei, and Olare Motorogi. The Great Migration is undoubtedly the greatest wildlife show on earth and for a portion of the year (August to October), it plays out in the Masai Mara. In July, the tumultuous herds of wildebeest, zebra, gazelle and topi gather their energy on the banks of the Mara River before they crash across over the coming weeks, hoping to dodge the waiting crocodile and big cats. They remain on the plains of the Mara until October, enjoying all the succulent grasses and fresh water they can – a sight you’ll enjoy with nary a tree to block your view. The Great Migration aside, the wildlife of the Masai Mara is a highlight all on its own. Four out of the Big Five can be spotted all year round, it’s just the rhino that remains elusive. The landscape also provides a unique chance to see cheetah sprinting across the plains in pursuit of antelope, while the rivers hold giant crocodile and pods of hippo, which you’ll see basking in the sun or foraging (on night drives). Kenya has an incredible range of birdlife with over 1000 species to be spotted, including the finely-feathered migratory birds. Birding is at its colourful peak between November and March, and twitchers will be amazed by the variety, from the tiniest bee-eater to eagles that soar overhead. This is the land of the Maasai and a visit to the Mara gives a true insight into their traditional way of life. In the conservancies, you are able to travel to a Maasai village, taste local beer and other delicacies, before joining the day’s activities and learning how to track wildlife from the masters on a walking safari.

          <h2>Masai People </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Maasai people are known globally for their vibrant red robes and tremendous bravery as <b>fierce warriors in the wild. </b>  Their way of life can seem unimaginable for many; living amongst the <b>punishing dangers of the natural world. </b>   A Maasai cultural experience is a fascinating insight into the life of the Maasai people, learning about their rich history and culture. From centuries of living amongst the untamed wild, the Maasai have <b>mastered living off the land. </b>

          </p>
          <h2> When to visit the Maasai Mara </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The best time to visit Maasai Mara is between <b>July and October, </b>  during the Great Migration. Temperatures remain pretty consistent year-round, and rainfall is all that separates the seasons. <b>January and February</b>  is the driest season. These months offer the best wildlife sightings and great conditions for safari. <b>March to May</b>  is the rainy season, and some lodges and camps will close in April when the rains are at their peak. <b>June to October</b>  follows with a short dry season, often punctuated with short, sharp showers. Temperatures are typically cooler at this time of year.           </p>
